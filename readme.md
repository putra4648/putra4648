## Hello There 👋

I'm Putra, I'm a software engineer, some of the languages ​​I know are __Java, JavaScript/Typescript, and Dart__.

There are also unwritten languages ​​like __Go__ and __C#__ that I've only tried out.

The main frameworks commonly used are __Springboot, Flutter, React, and Vue.__ Why isn't __Angular__ available? The learning curve isn't easy and these two already cover my needs.

Currently I am working on a side project called Warehouse Management System.
